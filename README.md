## Description
The Turtle Clock script is a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to create a simple analog clock. It displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands on a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Turtle. The clock updates in real-time, providing a visual representation of the current time.

## Features
* Analog clock representation.
* Real-time updating of the clock's hands.
* Customizable clock appearance (colors, sizes, etc.).
* Uses Python's built-in time module to fetch the current time.
  
## Prerequisites
Before running the Turtle Clock script, ensure you have the following:

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* The Turtle graphics library is a built-in Python module, so no additional installations are required.
  
## Usage
* Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Run the following command to start the clock:

>python turtle_clock.py

## Customization
* You can customize the appearance of the clock by modifying the script:
* Adjust the clock's colors, sizes, and other parameters by changing the values in the ghadi_bana function.
* Explore the Turtle documentation for more advanced customization options: Turtle Graphics Documentation
